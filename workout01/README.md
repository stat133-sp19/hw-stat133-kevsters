In this workout, we do three basic things with a set of shot data for 5 GSW Players (Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green).

First, we download the shot data for each of the 5 players.  Each row in the data table represents a shot, with each column being an attribute of the shot.

In the first main part, we create a summary for the shot data for each player.  We also concatenate all the shot data for each player into one big data frame
of shot data.

In the second main part, we create shot charts for each of the 5 players.  Using the combined data frame, we can facet wrap by player name to display
all 5 shot charts in a single plot

In the final part, we write a report, which includes an analysis of all the data.  It also involves creating 3 additional tables, each of which analyzes the 
shooting percentage of each player, from 2PT, 3PT, and general ranges respectively.
